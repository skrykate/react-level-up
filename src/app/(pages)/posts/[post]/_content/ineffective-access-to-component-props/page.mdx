<ContentWrapper>

In JavaScript and, consequently, in React, the concept of objects is often used to store component property values. Inside an object, many different values can be passed, which may not be immediately obvious to the component. This complicates working with a specific component, making code reading and maintenance more difficult.

Let's consider the following example:

```tsx
interface ChildComponentProps {
    title: string;
    content: string;
}

const ChildComponent: FC<ChildComponentProps> = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>{props.title}</h3>
            <p>{props.content}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

const ParentComponent: FC = () => {
    const data = {
        title: 'Title',
        content: 'Paragraph content',
    };

    return (
        <ChildComponent
            title={data.title}
            content={data.content}
        />
    );
};
```

In this example, the values of `props.title` and `props.content` are extracted directly from the `props` object within JSX. Although this approach works, it isn't optimal as it complicates code reading and understanding, especially when dealing with multiple props.

The best way to solve this problem is to use destructuring. This allows extracting object properties and assigning them to variables with the same names. Let's improve our code:

```tsx
interface ChildComponentProps {
    title: string;
    content: string;
}

const ChildComponent: FC<ChildComponentProps> = (props) => {
    const { title, content } = props;

    return (
        <div>
            <h3>{title}</h3>
            <p>{content}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

const ParentComponent: FC = () => {
    const data = {
        title: 'Title',
        content: 'Paragraph content',
    };

    return (
        <ChildComponent
            title={data.title}
            content={data.content}
        />
    );
};
```

This code is already easier to read as we explicitly define variables `title` and `content` from `props`. But we can do even better by destructuring properties directly in the function parameters:

```tsx
interface ChildComponentProps {
    title: string;
    content: string;
}

const ChildComponent: FC<ChildComponentProps> = ({ title, content }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>{title}</h3>
            <p>{content}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

const ParentComponent: FC = () => {
    const data = {
        title: 'Title',
        content: 'Paragraph content',
    };

    return (
        <ChildComponent
            title={data.title}
            content={data.content}
        />
    );
};
```

By using this approach, we make our component as readable and understandable as possible. Destructuring in function parameters immediately shows which properties the component expects.

Using destructuring improves code readability, enhances code structure and maintainability, making it more understandable for other developers and for you in the future. You immediately see which properties are used in the component. This is useful when you need to modify or extend the component in the future. You don't need to search through the function body to understand which properties are available.

Our examples are written in TypeScript, which certainly makes the code more obvious, but imagine code that doesn't use either TypeScript or destructuring. It would greatly complicate the work, thus slowing down the development process, which is critical in our dynamic world.
