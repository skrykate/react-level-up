## Explanation

The `useMatchMedia` hook simplifies responsive design implementation in React applications by streamlining media query management. Developers can define device-specific conditions with ease, abstracting away the complexities of directly working with `window.matchMedia`. This hook offers a straightforward interface for accessing media query results, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

By integrating `useMatchMedia`, developers can encapsulate media query logic within reusable components, fostering modular and scalable code structures. This enables efficient handling of different device sizes without cluttering component code with intricate conditions. With its intuitive API, `useMatchMedia` facilitates the creation of responsive designs, empowering developers to focus on crafting engaging user interfaces.

Furthermore, `useMatchMedia` promotes best practices by encouraging separation of concerns and encapsulation of functionality. Centralizing media query management within this custom hook promotes code reusability and simplifies maintenance efforts. This abstraction shields developers from the complexities of directly interacting with `MediaQueryList` objects, providing an ergonomic solution for responsive behavior in React components.

Developers can easily customize device-specific conditions according to their project requirements by modifying the `devices` object within the hook. By adjusting the key-value pairs in the `devices` object, developers can define their own breakpoints and media query conditions tailored to their application's design and layout needs.

In essence, `useMatchMedia` offers a streamlined approach to responsive design implementation, abstracting away the intricacies of media query handling while providing a clean and intuitive interface. Its integration within React components fosters code modularity, readability, and scalability, ultimately enhancing the development experience and delivering a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Creation

```typescript
// Define an object for different device types, each associated with a media
// query string that describes the screen size ranges for those devices
const devices = {
    isMobile: '(max-width: 766px)',
    isTablet: '(min-width: 767px) and (max-width: 1199px)',
    isDesktop: '(min-width: 1200px)',
};

// Create an array by mapping over the values of the `devices` object,
// to generate a `MediaQueryList` object for each media query string.
// These objects are used to check if the document matches the media query
const mediaQueryLists = Object.values(devices).map((query) => {
    return window.matchMedia(query);
});

// Function to get an array of boolean values by mapping over `mediaQueryLists`,
// where each boolean indicates whether the respective media query
// currently matches the document state
const getValues = (): boolean[] => {
    return mediaQueryLists.map((list: MediaQueryList) => list.matches);
};

// Define the return type of the hook.
// The keys represent device types, and the values indicate the match status for each device type
type MatchMediaResult = Record<string, boolean>;

const useMatchMedia = (): MatchMediaResult => {
    const [values, setValues] = useState<boolean[]>(getValues);

    useLayoutEffect(() => {
        // Define the handler function that updates the state when the status of a media query changes
        const handleChange = () => {
            setValues(getValues());
        };

        // Attach an event listener for the `change` event to each `MediaQueryList`
        // in `mediaQueryLists`, so that `handleChange` is called whenever the match
        // status of a media query changes
        mediaQueryLists.forEach((list) =>
            list.addEventListener('change', handleChange)
        );

        // Return a cleanup function that removes the event listeners
        // from each `MediaQueryList` when the component unmounts,
        // ensuring there are no duplicate listeners
        return () =>
            mediaQueryLists.forEach((list) =>
                list.removeEventListener('change', handleChange)
            );
    }, []);

    // Create an object by reducing over the keys of devices,
    // mapping each device type to its corresponding boolean value
    // from the values array, which represents the match status
    const deviceIndicators: MatchMediaResult = Object.keys(devices).reduce(
        (acc, screen, index) => ({
            ...acc,
            [screen]: values[index],
        }),
        {}
    );

    // Return the object containing device indicators,
    // which provide a boolean value for each device type indicating
    // whether the current screen size matches the corresponding media query
    return deviceIndicators;
};

export default useMatchMedia;

## Example Usages

### Dynamic Component Rendering Based on Device Type

This example demonstrates how to use the `useMatchMedia` custom hook to create a responsive layout that adapts based on the device type. The hook returns values indicating whether the user is on a mobile, tablet, or desktop device. Based on this, different components are rendered for each device type, ensuring an optimized user experience across various screen sizes. This approach allows the UI to dynamically adjust and provide the most suitable layout for each device.

```tsx
const Container: FC = () => {
    // Destructure the values returned by the custom hook
    const { isMobile, isTablet } = useMatchMedia();

    return (
        <Layer title="Container">
            {
                // Render different components based on the device type
                isMobile ? (
                    // If the device is mobile, render the `MobileComponent`
                    <MobileComponent />
                ) : // If the device is not mobile, check if it's a tablet
                isTablet ? (
                    // If it's, render the `TabletComponent`,
                    <TabletComponent />
                ) : (
                    // otherwise, render the `DesktopComponent`
                    <DesktopComponent />
                )
            }
        </Layer>
    );
};
```

### Adaptive Menu Based on Device Type

This example demonstrates how to conditionally render different menu components based on the device type using the `useMatchMedia` custom hook. When viewed on a mobile device, the `HamburgerMenu` is displayed, providing a compact navigation option. On larger screens, the `RegularMenu` is shown, offering a more traditional navigation layout. This approach ensures an optimized user experience across various devices.

```tsx
const Container: FC = () => {
    const { isMobile } = useMatchMedia();

    return (
        <Layer title="Container">
            {
                // Conditional rendering of menu component based on device type
                isMobile ? <HamburgerMenu /> : <RegularMenu />
            }
        </Layer>
    );
};
```

### Responsive Grid Layout with Dynamic Device Adaptation

This example demonstrates a responsive grid layout that adapts to different device types. Using the `useMatchMedia` custom hook, the layout dynamically adjusts the number of columns based on whether the user is on a mobile, tablet, or desktop device. The class for the container is dynamically set with the `containerClass` variable, which ensures that the appropriate grid styles are applied based on the device type. This ensures an optimized user experience across various screen sizes, making the interface more intuitive and user-friendly.

```css
.container {
    /* Styles for mobile devices */
    /* Blocks are stacked vertically */
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);
    gap: 8px;
    max-height: 320px;
    overflow-y: auto;
    padding: 16px 0;
    width: 100%;
}

.tablet {
    /* Additional styles for tablet devices */
    /* Blocks are arranged in a 2-column grid */
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}

.desktop {
    /* Additional styles for desktop devices */
    /* Blocks are arranged in a 3-column grid */
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

```tsx
const items = loadData(6);

const Container: FC = () => {
    const { isTablet, isDesktop } = useMatchMedia();

    // Determine the container class based on the device type.
    // If the device is a desktop, set the container class to "desktop".
    // If it's a tablet, set the container class to "tablet".
    // otherwise (if it's a mobile device) keep it as "container".
    const containerClass = isDesktop ? 'desktop' : isTablet ? 'tablet' : '';

    return (
        <Layer title="Container">
            <Message>
                Dynamic styling adapted to your device. Block positions adjust
                seamlessly based on screen size.
            </Message>
            <div className="relative border-y-4 border-neutral-900 dark:border-neutral-100">
                <div className={cn('container', containerClass)}>
                    {items.map((item) => (
                        <Square key={item.id}>
                            <span className="font-monoBrand p-4 text-center text-2xl">
                                {item.name}
                            </span>
                        </Square>
                    ))}
                </div>
            </div>
        </Layer>
    );
};
